ALL:
* Need a floppy driver to be able to do filesystem, the easiest is
  probably to do a simpler driver first, like the keyboard. To work
  out driver details


BOOT/LOADER32:
* Use native filesystem

KERNEL:
* Extend process_t as needed
* Drivers as processes or as kernel code?
*
* Processes are not swithcing to kernel mode correctly, they change TSS
  should use same TSS and move to kernel mode with same address space. Makes
  syscalls easier (passing strings in particular). 
  See kernel/fork.c (copy_process) in linux 0.01.





MM:
* kmalloc needs work, does not return anything to system

SYSCALLS:
* Investigate reentrability
* Start implementing syscalls, current status: 
      (+=tested, *=exists, -=missing)

INTERRUPTS/EXCEPTIONS:
* I suspect the stack handling is wicked and wrong
  (What's the TSS fields for?)

FS:
* Construct ordinary inode filesystem
* Add process_t stuff needed
* Need a open files table
* Block/Inode caches
